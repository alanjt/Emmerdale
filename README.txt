Flightgear scenery for Emmerdale TV set

Installation

Make a directory for your local scenery. On my system this is C:\Flightgear\MyScenery.

Copy all files and directories into this local scenery directory. You should now have a directory C:\Flightgear\MyScenery\Objects 

Add the local scenery directory to your Flightgear start options  e.g. :-
 
 --fg-scenery=C:\FlightGear\MyScenery
